# HTML Goddess Mono Repo

## To Do
- fix: git save/publish commands not cleaning up.
- Create print:auto, publish, a11y, proofread commands.
- Figure out a best practice way to safely call htmlgoddess npm if possible, or good way to expose API interface.
- Migrate this to new branch on existing repo.
- Find good spell checker.
