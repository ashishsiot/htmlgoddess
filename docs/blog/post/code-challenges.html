      <h1>Code Challenges</h1>
      <p>
        This has become something that has become controversial in recent years
        because a lot of the time the things that the code challenge are testing are
        not actually going to be in your day to day. I have yet to come across a
        problem where I had to use Fibonacci numbers, and I don't expect to.
      </p>
      <p>
        I must admit I am not particularly good at these challenges. I've been
        working on this a lot and am getting better, but I've got a long way to go.
        Regardless, I think code challenges are actually a good thing to test people
        on and to do. Despite the fact that many of the tasks are not "real world"
        scenarios, they do use the same part of the brain. They also require you to
        build a set of conceptual tools competently, which in turns necessitates
        strategically studying, training, and self-evaluating over an extended
        period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last aspect is what I've come to enjoy. The building of these skills
        and to be able to start to employ these techniques to problems of this
        nature as a problem in and of itself. How can I invest in building this
        skill in such a way where it is not a herculean task
