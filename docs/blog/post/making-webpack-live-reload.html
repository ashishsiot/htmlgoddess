      <h1>Making HTML Godess Live Reload</h1>
      <p>May 29, 2020</p>
      <p>
        As I write this, I've been struggling a bit over an hour trying to get
        webpack to do what seems like it should be relatively simple thing, whenever
        an HTML page in the src folder is edited, recompile the templates and live
        reload the browser. At each step of the way, I've run into difficulties
        because webpack's built-in "live-reload" functionality was not designed with
        HTML in mind. Webpack was actually not really intended to be an HTML
        compiler at all, but a JS & CSS, which while I respect is unfortunate in
        this case.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I've had to call in reinforcements. I'll be rolling my own watcher,
        compiler & browser reloader. For the job I'm going to try prettier,
        onchange, and an npm lib called "open", which I found by digging into the
        webpack-dev-server internals. I've used prettier and onchange so I have a
        good idea of how those work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general I don't like to rebuild the wheel but it's obvious at this point
        that I'm running askew of the original use case of webpack-dev-server so it
        will have to do. In this case I think it will be ok as long as I'm not
        technically "hacking" anything in webpack.
      </p>
      <h3>The Webpack livereload feature is pretty difficult to customize</h3>
      <p>
        Coming back to it again after a couple days, I've made some headway. After
        struggling to get the existing live reload plugins to work, I've settled on
        rolling my own livereload server using the underlying module that webpack
        uses and loading it independently. I think this is a classic case of a
        framework biting off more than it can chew. By using the individual modules
        independent of webpack I have a much smoother cohesion between the various
        components:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Onchange watches for changes in the src folder and calls webpack.</li>
        <li>Webpack compiles the source files into the output directory.</li>
        <li>
          Livereload watches only the output directory and tells the browser to
          reload.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Notice you can remove anyone of the parts and the essential functionality of
        each part is preserved and intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        With webpack-dev-server the use case is a bit ambiguous. Yes it's a dev
        server, but it's also a watcher and also a live reloader. Getting access to
        those options and configuring them is often not possible because they were
        composed with particular use cases in mind. There's also overlap with
        "webpack --watch" which does certain things, and the webpack-devserver
        plugin which does other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still have a little to do, I need to automatically add the JS to template
        when the dev server is loaded. I need to think about how I'm going to do
        this so it's straightforward and I'm not creating something that will trip
        somebody up. Also I want to make the watcher more efficient so it only
        triggers the files that are affected. Right now the entire site is
        recompiled everytime you save and this obviously won't scale. For now I'm
        happy with the progress made so I'll leave this for another day.
