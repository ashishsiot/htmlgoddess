      <h1>Making Webpack Live Reload</h1>
      <p>May 29, 2020</p>
      <p>
        As I write this, I've been struggling a bit over an hour trying to get
        webpack to do what seems like it should be relatively simple thing, whenever
        an HTML page in the src folder is edited, recompile the templates and live
        reload the browser. At each step of the way, I've run into difficulties
        become the use case for webpack's built-in "live-reload" functionality was
        not designed with this in mind. Webpack was actually not really intended to
        be an HTML compiler at all, which while I respect is unfortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I've had to call in reinforcements. I'll be rolling my own watcher,
        compiler & browser reloader. For the job I'm going to try prettier,
        onchange, and an npm lib called "open", which I found by digging into the
        webpack-dev-server internals.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general I don't like to rebuild the wheel but it's obvious at this point
        that I'm running askew of the original use case of webpack-dev-server so it
        will have to do. In this case I think it will be ok as long as I'm not
        techincally "hacking" anything in webpack.
      </p>
