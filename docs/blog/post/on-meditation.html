      <h1>Count to Ten Meditation</h1>
      <p>May 28, 2020</p>
      <p>This is a basic meditation technique that I practice.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sit comfortably, either cross legged or in a chair, and with an upright
          posture. Imagine a string going out the top of your head like a puppet and
          pulling gently on the top of your spine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Close your eyes (or if you prefer keep them open) and take a few deep
          breaths to get settled.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you are settled, breath in slowly through your nose and then out
          blissfully, focusing on the sensation of the air going in and out of your
          nostrils.
        </li>
        <li>
          After each exhalation count silently to yourself 1,2,3, etc... until you
          reach the count of 10.
        </li>
        <li>Once you reach 10 simply begin again at 1.</li>
        <li>
          If you become distracted by thoughts, sounds, or sensations, and forget
          what number you are on, it's OK and completely natural. Simply bring your
          attention back to the breath and start again
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat as long as suits you, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, it does not
          matter where, when, or how long. Remember, the point is not to count to
          10, but rather to work with your mind's attention and the thoughts and
          sensations that are ever-present.
        </li>
      </ol>
