        Patterns of Self Organization
      </h1>
      <p>May 29, 2020</p>
      <p>
        Something that I'm trying to achieve with this framework is to make the
        structure of things self organizing so that an increase in the complexity of
        the elements and content is organized naturally and does not require more
        complex patterns or knowledge to handle. This is something I've noticed with
        many frameworks. As the use case grows beyond what it was originally
        intended for, more and more complex additions get added that require more
        knowledge to manage properly. If not managed properly the use of these
        frameworks can cause more issues than if no framework was used at all!
        Perhaps this is just an innate aspect of design patterns when they get
        applied in the real world, but nevertheless I hope to mitigate that effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do I mean by "self organizing"? In nature, there exist certain patterns
        that have allowed organisms and ecosystems to develop to an arbitrary
        complexity based on a few simple rules. One such example is trees which
        sprout branches at a specific ratio. [ratio here] Furthermore, the trees
        themselves have been found to be sized and spaced around each other at this
        specifc ratio. The same pattern is found within our circulatory system in
        the human body, the spirals of sea shells, and galaxies. One can wonder why,
        but my theory is that evolution has selected this pattern again and again
        because it works. I've always found the best frameworks to have this fractal
        aspect to it, that makes it so that you can think at a "relative" level, and
        not have to worry about the entire system as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the reason why I've opted to include some of these constraints in
        this framework. By avoiding classes, it limits in how much you can customize
        but also preempts the pitfalls of arbitrary styles and classes. You can now
        take any stylesheet from anywhere in the world that targets plain HTML and
        just drop it in.
      </p>
      <p>
        By avoiding javascript, you lose the ability to manipulate content
        dynamically, but you gain the speed and ease of use that comes with
        simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        With using html tags for the templating, you require the user to only know
        one syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the filesystem for the url routing allows the user to think naturally
        about how they want to structure their content.
