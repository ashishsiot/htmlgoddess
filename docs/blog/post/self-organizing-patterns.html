        Patterns of Self Organization
      </h1>
      <p>May 29, 2020</p>
      <p>
        Something that I'm trying to achieve with this framework is to make the
        structure of things self organizing so that an increase in the complexity of
        the elements and content is organized naturally and does not require more
        complex patterns or knowledge to handle. This is something I've noticed with
        many frameworks. As the framework gets applied to more and more use cases,
        more and more complex additions get added, which requires yet more knowledge
        to maintain properly. This addition in complexity cost inevitably means that
        these frameworks will not be applied properly, and can result in costly
        maintenance and issues. words, bloat. Perhaps this is an innate aspect of
        what happens design patterns when they get applied in the real world, but
        nevertheless I hope to mitigate that effect as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do I mean by "self organizing"? In nature, there exist certain patterns
        that have allowed organisms and ecosystems to develop to an arbitrary
        complexity based on a few simple rules. One such example is trees which
        sprout branches at a specific ratio. [ratio here] Furthermore, the trees
        themselves have been found to be sized and spaced around each other at this
        specific ratio. The same pattern is found within our circulatory system in
        the human body, the spirals of sea shells, and galaxies. One can wonder why,
        but my theory is that evolution has selected this pattern again and again
        because it works. I've always found the best frameworks to have this fractal
        aspect to it, that makes it so that you can think at a "relative" level, and
        not have to worry about the entire system as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the reason why I've opted to include some of these constraints in
        this framework. By avoiding classes, it limits in how much you can customize
        but also preempts the pitfalls of arbitrary styles and classes. You can now
        take any stylesheet from anywhere in the world that targets plain HTML and
        just drop it in.
      </p>
      <p>
        By avoiding javascript, you lose the ability to manipulate content
        dynamically, but you gain the speed and ease of use that comes with
        simplified state management.
      </p>
      <p>
        With using html tags for the templating, you require the user to only know
        one language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the filesystem for the url routing also allows the user to think
        naturally about how they want to structure their content. It's intuitive to
        think that how you access your pages in a browsers will work the same as how
        you access your files on your computer. It's true that at a certain point
        you have two much content and then it can become cumbersome but I believe
        for the majority of people making websites this is actually not an issue.
