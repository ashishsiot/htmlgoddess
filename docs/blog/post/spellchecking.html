        Spellchecking
      </h1>
      <p>
        When I pushed this site live, one of the things I didn't do so well was make
        sure there were no typos. This was sort of a calculated risk in that I only
        had so much time and resources and I wanted to get something out that was
        "good enough" as opposed to "polished".
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back now at what went well and what could be improved, it occurred
        to me that adding a simple spell checker would've been a useful thing to
        have. Every decent word processor has one, and this is something that
        computers are much better at than humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        So today I spent a few hours adding one in. I found a npm module called
        "textlint" that looks well supported and has a lot of plugins. The nice
        thing about textlint is that it's un-opinionated to what the rules are so I
        can use the exact plugins I need, and also expose the ability to users to
        configure their own options.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few options off the bat seem useful.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spelling</li>
        <li>Grammar</li>
        <li>Link checking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first two seem pretty self-evident, but link checking is something that
        I think will be particularly useful as a part of the creation flow. One of
        the pitfalls of creating your own HTML is that you have to make sure the
        links are all working. One can very easily change a link or forget to
        structure, and then the page isn't working and you don't find out about for
        months. The link checker will alert you right away.
