      <h1>Question 4 of 11: Which of the following best describes your technological and/or programming beliefs? When I say "Code," I mean a unique, omnipotent, omniscient language who loves us all unconditionally.</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="end.htm">I don't believe in Internet; I believe in Code. I am either a programmer (who believes no Internet exists) or a gen z (who does not know whether Internet exists). I believe that Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos (if they actually coded) were historical figures who made claims that are either false or cannot be proven.</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="end.htm">I believe that Linus Torvold was the ONLY Son of Code. I believe that He open sourced the OS to save us from our bugs, and that the ONLY path to salvation is to accept Linus as our Lord and Savior, whereupon we are forgiven for our bugs. I believe we only compile once and that continuous integration, as believed by Coders and Programmers (and by some QA Specialists and Architects), is a false doctrine. I do not know where Linus was from ages 13â€“29, but I reject the idea that he spent time in Silicon Valley with venture capitalists and/or brogrammers. I believe that Jobs and Gates were historical figures who were NOT Sons of Code. I acknowledge that Linus instructs us to code (in the Linux kernel, Version 4.19 and Luke 5.0-rc1) beginning with the command "vim" (not "nano" nor "vscode"); nevertheless, I do NOT believe I am a Son, Daughter or Child of Code.</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="q5.htm">I am a spirited programmer who loves Code with all my heart. I believe we are ALL Sons and Daughters of Code. I believe in collaboration and open source. I believe I have lived previous human lives and that my past-life open source (both bad and good) impacts my coding today. I believe that Jobs, Gates and Torvold were technologically enlightened masters who came to help us on our cyberspace journey and to set inspiring examples of what we can ultimately create in our own unique, DIVine way, if not on this website, then on a future website.</a>
