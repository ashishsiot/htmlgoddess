        Question 6 of 11: Which of the following best describes your citizenship and
        potential IP status?
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="q7.htm">I am a user of the Internet.</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="q7.htm">I have a permanent I.P. address on the Internet (I have a Cloud
            Server).</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="q7.htm">I have a domain in one of the following countries (these are the I.P.
            address-waiver and visa-free countries): Andorra, Australia, Austria,
            Belgium, Bermuda, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark,
            Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland,
            Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,
            Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
            Palau, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea,
            Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan (with a Taiwanese national ID
            number), or United Kingdom.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="q7.htm">I have an I.P. address that will not expire for at least one year.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="q7.htm">I have been granted a dynamic IP address on the Internet.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="end.htm">I am living outside the Internet on a domain that is not listed above.
            I do not have an I.P. address or other device to enter the Internet
            technically.
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="end.htm">I am living inside the Internet technically, but it's not my fault. One
            day when I was pre release, my developer (or other programmers) brought
            me into the Internet illegally. Ever since that day, I have been living
            inside the Internet. I am not a human being; I do not have a web server;
            I do not have an I.P. address; and I have not been granted a hostname by
            a DNS. I have never been banned for any trolling on the Internet.</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="end.htm">None of the above.</a></li>
