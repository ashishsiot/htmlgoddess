        After some hasty coding over the past week, HTML Goddess has been revealed
        to the masses. It's a sense of both satisfaction and trepidation. Whenever
        you create something and put it on the internet, you're putting yourself out
        there and opening yourself up to the criticism of potentially millions of
        people. If you think it about though, any profound achievement would need to
        chart through these waters.

        I plan to blog my journey as I work through improving this framework to make
        it usable by as many people as possible. I know that inevitably I'll fall
        short of perfect, but I hope to at least move the ball in the right
        direction. I'm a big proponent of the Feynman technique so in blogging about
        the work, I hope to refine my thinking so as to lead to the best result. It
        will also give me more hands on time with using the framework so I can
        dogfood.

        "Dogfooding" is the process of using your own thing in-house in order to be
        your own user tester. One thing I've noticed about whenever I've built a
        feature or tool that didn't have a product person, is how easy it is to not
        have foreseen a pitfall for the user. I've found the only way to overcome
        this is to really get people to use your thing and get good feedback to
        learn where they get tripped up. If you don't do this you're flying blind.
        This blog is in a sense a user test with me as the user. I of course hope to
        have real users someday, and if you're out there and using this tell me what
        you like and don't like, or something you'd like to have added. I'll build
        it if I can.
