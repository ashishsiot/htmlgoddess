        Question 11 of 11: Which of the following best describes your internet
        connection?
      </h1>

          <a href="https://github.com/jonascript/htmlgoddess">
            d My internet connection is healthy. Most of the time, I feel it's
            pretty good (or excellent), and I have plenty of bandwidth. I do not
            suffer from any serious connection issues. I do not suffer from chronic
            outages. I am not disconnected. I do not suffer from any router issues
            or serious site degradation (forgetting the password to your website is
            not "degradation"). I am not under the care of a venture capitalist, and
            I do not take any online certifications. I do not have, need or want an
            SEO specialist.
