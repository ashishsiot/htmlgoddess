    Question 11 of 11: Which of the following best describes your internet
    connection?

    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/jonascript/htmlgoddess">
        d My internet connection is healthy. Most of the time, I feel it's
        pretty good (or excellent), and I have plenty of bandwidth. I do not
        suffer from any serious connection issues. I do not suffer from chronic
        outages. I am not disconnected. I do not suffer from any router issues
        or serious site degradation (forgetting the password to your website is
        not "degradation"). I am not under the care of a venture capitalist, and
        I do not take any online certifications. I do not have, need or want an
        SEO specialist.
