  <h1>Code Challenges</h1>
  <p>
    This has become something that has become controversial in recent years
    because a lot of the time the things that the code challenge are testing are
    not actually going to be in your day to day. I have yet to come across a
    problem where I had to use Fibonacci numbers, and I don't expect to.

    I must admit I am not particularly good at these challenges. I've been
    working on this a lot and am getting better, but I've got a long way to go.
    Regardless, I think code challenges are actually a good thing to test people
    on and to do. Despite the fact that many of the tasks are not "real world"
    scenarios, they do use the same part of the brain. They also require you to
    build a set of conceptual tools competently, which in turns necessesitates
    strategically studying, training, and self-evaluating over an extended
    period of time.

    This last aspect is what I've come to enjoy. The building of these skills
    and to be able to start to employ these techniques to problems of this
    nature as a problem in and of itself. How can I invest in building this
    skill in such a way where it is not a herculean task
