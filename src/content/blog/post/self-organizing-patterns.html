  <h1>
    Patterns of Self Organization

    Something that I'm trying to achieve with this framework is to make the
    structure of things self organizing so that an increase in the complexity of
    the elements and content grows naturally and does not require more complex
    patterns or knowledge to handle. This is something I've noticed with many
    frameworks. As the use case grows beyond what it was originally intended
    for, more and more complex additions get added that require more knowledge
    to manage properly. If not managed properly the use of these frameworks can
    cause more issues than if no framework was used at all! Perhaps this is just
    an innate aspect of design patterns when they get applied in the reality, but nevertheless I hope to mitigate
    that effect.

    What do I mean by "self organizing"? In nature there exist certain patterns
    that have allowed organisms and ecosystems to develop to an arbitrary
    complexity based on a few simple rules. One such example is trees which
    sprout branches at a specific ratio. [ratio here] Furthermore, the trees
    themselves have been found to be sized and spaced around each other at this
    specifc ratio. The same pattern is found within our circulatory system in
    the human body, the spirals of sea shells, and galaxies. One can wonder why,
    but my theory is that evolution has selected this pattern again and again
    because it works. I've always found the best frameworks to have this fractal
    aspect to it, that makes it so that you can think at a "relative" level, and
    not have to worry about the entire system as a whole.

    This is the reason why I've opted to include some of these constraints in
    the framework. By avoiding classes, it limits in how much you can customize
    but also preempts the pitfalls of arbitrary styles and classes. You can now
    take any stylesheet from anywhere in the world that targets plain HTML and
    just drop it in.

    By avoiding javascript you lose that dynamic ability but you gain the speed
    and ease of use that comes with simplicity.

    With using html tags for the templating, you require the user to only know
    one syntax. Using the filesystem for the url routing again allows the user
    to think naturally about how they want to structure their content.
