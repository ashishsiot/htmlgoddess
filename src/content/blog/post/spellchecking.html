    Spellchecking
  </h1>
  <p>
    When I pushed this site live, one of the things I didn't do so well was make
    sure there were no typos. This was sort of a calculated risk in that I only
    had so much time and resources and I wanted to get something out that was
    "good enough" as opposed to "polished".
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking back now at what went well and what could be improved, it occurred
    to me that adding a simple spell checker would've been a useful thing to
    have. Every decent word processor has one, and this is something that
    computers are much better at than humans.

  <p>
    So today I spent a few hours adding one in. I found a npm module called
    "textlint" that looks well supported and has a lot of plugins. The nice
    thing about textlint is that it's un-opinionated to what the rules are so I
    can use the exact plugins I need, and also expose the ability to users to
    configure their own options.

    A few options off the bat seem useful.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spelling</li>
    <li>Grammar</li>
    <li>Link checking</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The first two seem pretty self-evident, but link checking is something that
    I think will be particularly useful as a part of the creation flow. One of
    the pitfalls of creating your own HTML is that you have to make sure the
    links are all working. One can very easily change a link or forget to
    structure, and then the page isn't working and you don't find out about for
    months. The link checker will alert you right away.
