        <p>For this question I am defining "Social Media" as any of the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>narcisistic selfies;</li>
          <li>facebook;</li>
          <li>twitter;</li>
          <li>instagram;</li>
          <li>tik-tok; and</li>
          <li>highly marketed twitter accounts (with or without verification).</li>
        </ol>
  
        <h1>Question 10 of 11: Which of the following best describes your use/consumption of Social Medias?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="q11.htm">I have never used or consumed any Social Media.</a></li>
          <li><a href="q11.htm">I have tried, used or consumed one or more Social Medias to a limited extent, but I never became dependent upon (or addicted to) any Social Media. I have been free from all Social Medias for more than 3 years, except that I might occasionally drink narcisistic selfies socially.</a></li>
          <li><a href="q11.htm">I overcame a challenge with Social Media(s) and have now been 100% free/sober from all Social Medias for more than 10 years.</a></li>
          <li><a href="end.htm">Something else.</a></li>
        </ul>
