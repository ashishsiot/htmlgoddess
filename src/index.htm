      <h1>Seeking Awesome HTML Goddess</h1>
      <p>Hi. </p>
      <p>You may be wondering why this <a href="">website</a> looks like it was built in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>A few months ago, someone shared an odd website at work. I had a chuckle at it myself, the more I looked at it, the more I became inspired.</p>

      <p>It was clear, concise, and it had a Google Pagespeed score of 100.</p> 
        
      <p>The CSS was meticulously crafted, with detailed comments guiding the way for future explorers who may run astray. Regardless of what your politics is, here was a man who, all on his own, taught himself HTML and CSS, and built himself a website <i>to find love</i>.</p>

      <p>For the first time in recent memory, I had encountered HTML and CSS being used in the way originally intended. Now that's not to say that the modern web is not incredible for its capabilities, flexibility, and durability. It's just that perhaps, in our ceaseless march towards bigger and better things, we have forgotten who the HTML standard was created for, <i>people</i>.</p>

      <p>What we web developers know, but John & Joan Q Public may not realize, is that the amount of complexity in your typical website these days rivals that of a desktop application. Frontend developers are now bona fide software engineers with entire ecosystems of modules, design patterns, and methodologies, which are constantly evolving, requiring yet more and more complex strategies to manage. I won't lament these advances as the web today is truly a global versatile platform capable of incredible things, but there's a cost to that, and some are paying the price more than others.</p>

      <p><i>The web should not just be accessible to those wanting to consume, but also to those also wanting to create</i>.</p>

      <p>Sure there a companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, whose platforms have become mediums in their own right, however, the web was never intended to be a place where you need  a billion dollar platform to express yourself. Even wordpress requires the consultation of a developer if you want to do anything with a sense of security.</p>

      <p>That's why I made this site generator. It is a no frills, website generator, that will let you write HTML, CSS, like its 1999. I wouldn't be surprised if other people have made things similar to this, and if you have good on you, but this as much an exercise for me in getting back to basics as it is supposed to be something unique.</p>

      <p>In setting out on this endeavor I set myself a few principles by which I am doing my best to strictly adhere. </p>
      <ol>
          <li>
            It will be <i>simple</i> as humanly possible to use. No classes, no javascript. No frills. You want pretty, go <a href="https://squarespace.com">here</a>, you want simple, you've come to the right place.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will be <i>accessible</i> in every sense of the word. Accessible not only to people with disabilities, but to people who are not programmers, may have slower internet connections, or may need to get something up and running quickly without fuss.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will be <i>extendable</i>. I have little desire to have to argue with people about what should or should not be included in my glorious creation. If someone wants to turn this into a code splitted react application, be my guest, but it will always be built for someone like my dad who can't figure out how to work the smart TV.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will be <i>fast</i>. It's time to put the hyper back in hypertext. Without all the complexity of what is standard issue with most websites, this is actually comes out of the box.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will be <i>free</i>. No corporations, middlemen, or censors. If you have a computer and you can figure out how to connect it to the internet, you can serve whatever website you want.
          </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I honestly don't know if this will be seen by anyone, but if you're out there, and you're reading this, and you want to make a website but you don't know where to start, you can start by clicking on the link below. If you manage to make it through all 11 questions without a kiss goodbye, then you will have the opportunity to fill out a detailed form and submit it to me with your photos, and I will make you an HTML Goddess.
