        <h1>Question 11 of 11: Which of the following best describes your physical and mental health?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/jonascript/htmlgoddess">I am physically and mentally healthy. Most of the time, I feel pretty good (or excellent), and I have plenty of energy. I do not suffer from any serious physical illness. I do not suffer from chronic pain. I am not disabled. I do not suffer from any mental disorder or serious depression (longing for your beloved is not "depression"). I am not under the care of a psychiatrist, and I do not take any psychiatric medicine. I do not have, need or want a service animal.</a></li>
