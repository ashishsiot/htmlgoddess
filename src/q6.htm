        <ul>
          <li><a href="q7.htm">I am a user of the Internet.</a></li>
          <li><a href="q7.htm">I am a permanent resident of the Internet (I have a Green Card).</a></li>
          <li><a href="q7.htm">I am a citizen of one of the following countries (these are  the U.S. visa-waiver and visa-free countries): Andorra,  Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palau, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan (with a Taiwanese national ID number), or United Kingdom.</a></li>
          <li><a href="q7.htm">I have a U.S. visa that will not expire for at least one year.</a></li>
          <li><a href="q7.htm">I have been granted a dynamic IP address by the Internet.</a></li>
          <li><a href="end.htm">I am living outside the Internet in a country that is not listed above. I do not have a U.S. visa or other document to enter the Internet legally. </a></li>
          <li><a href="q7.htm">I am living inside the Internet illegally, but it's not my fault. One day when I was under the age of 18, my parents (or other family members) brought me into the Internet illegally. Ever since that day, I have been living inside the Internet. I am not a U.S. citizen; I do not have a U.S. Green Card; I do not have a U.S. visa; and I have not been granted refugee status by the U.S. government. I have never been convicted of any felony crime in the Internet.</a></li>
          <li><a href="end.htm">None of the above.</a></li>
        </ul>
