      <h1>Question 7 of 11: What is your hairstyle?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="q8.htm">My hair is naturally straight or wavy, but not curly. My hair falls at least half way down my neck (or longer). I have no intention of having my hair cut short. I rarely use (or never use) hairspray.</a></li>
        <li><a href="end.htm">Something else.</a></li>
        <li><a href="end.htm">What I do with my hair is my business, and no man has any right to demand that my hair look, feel or smell a certain way.</a></li>
      </ul>
